# Content Filtering Debug Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you troubleshoot issues with content filtering in the admin dashboard. We've added a "Search" button to apply filters all at once, which should fix the problem where filters were not being correctly applied.

## Changes Made
1. Added a search button to apply all filters at once
2. Modified the API calls to include all filter parameters (status, category, contentType, difficulty, pool, search)
3. Updated the backend controller to properly process all filter parameters
4. Added debug logging to help diagnose issues

## IMPORTANT: How to Use Filters
1. Select your filters (Status, Category, Content Type, etc.)
2. **ALWAYS click the Search button** to apply your changes
3. The system no longer auto-refreshes when you change a filter - you must click Search

## Debug Process

### Step 1: Check Browser Console
Open your browser's developer tools (F12 or right-click â†’ Inspect) and go to the Console tab. When you click the Search button, you should see debug information printed:
```
=== FILTER DEBUG ===
Status: all
Category: 681fc1e531caf471bdbbd46b
Content Type: all
Difficulty: beginner
Pool: all
Search Term: 

=== API CALL PARAMETERS ===
Category filter: 681fc1e531caf471bdbbd46b
```

The debug output shows which parameters are being used in the filter. Make sure the Category ID matches the one you selected.

### Step 2: Check Backend Logs
The backend will now log the filter query being sent to the database. Check your server logs for entries like:
```
Content filter query: {
  "status": "published",
  "category": "681fc1e531caf471bdbbd46b",
  "difficulty": "beginner"
}
```

### Step 3: Testing Filters
1. Clear all filters by navigating to the "All" tab
2. Select one filter at a time (e.g., set Category to "Business Hacks")
3. **Click the Search button** (this is required - filters are not applied automatically)
4. Verify that only content with the selected category is displayed

### Step 4: Common Issues and Solutions

#### Filters not applying correctly
- **Make sure you click the Search button after selecting filters** - this is the most common issue
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify that filter values are being passed correctly in the network request (Network tab in developer tools)

#### No search results
- Try with fewer filters to see if any content matches your criteria
- Check if the database contains content matching all your filter criteria

#### API errors
- Check browser network tab for failed API calls
- Review server logs for error messages

## Technical Details

### Frontend Filter Flow
1. User selects filters (status, category, contentType, difficulty, pool)
2. User clicks Search button
3. `handleSearch()` function is called:
   - Debug logs are printed to console
   - Page is reset to first page
   - `handleRefresh()` is called to fetch filtered data
   - Category filter is now properly included in the API call

### Backend Filtering
The content controller applies filters as follows:
- Status filter (respects user role permissions)
- Category filter (exact match on category ID)
- Content Type filter (exact match)
- Difficulty filter (exact match)
- Pool filter (exact match)
- Search term (regex match on title, summary, body, tags)
